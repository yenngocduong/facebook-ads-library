       "  'ad_creative_bodies': [\"SaveTexans, there is something seriously wrong with our state’s “natural” (i.e. methane) gas marketplace.  In most of the rest of the country, the power of pipeline companies to impact gas prices is limited in various ways, including prohibiting them from owning the gas that moves through their lines.  Prices are typically capped, published and readily available to buyers and sellers.  Texas has no such rules.  Instead, we give pipeline companies power that borders on monopolistic, allowing them to own the gas they transport and to hide their pricing and capacity until days after gas is sold, leaving buyers and sellers in the dark during negotiations.  This came home to roost last February when Winter Storm Uri shut down much of the state’s electric grid, leaving “natural” gas in short supply and great demand.  Within days, companies like Energy Transfer and Kinder Morgan – two of our 'Terrible 12' fossil fuel exporters – raised gas prices astronomically (in at least one case, from $3 per million British thermal units to $500 per mmbtu), quickly earning the two companies combined profits of $3.4 billion and leaving Texans to pay the tab for the next decade or longer.  Think state leaders might do something about it?  Think again.  Pipeline companies are regulated by the three elected Railroad Commissioners.  Between 2015 and 2020, companies with permit applications before the commission donated over $2.6 million to their campaigns.  In the immortal words of Jerry Reed, they get the goldmine and we get the shaft…\\nhttps://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Texas-gas-market-pipeline-companies-17145574.php\"],\n",

       "  'ad_creative_bodies': [\"SaveTexans, there is something seriously wrong with our state’s “natural” (i.e. methane) gas marketplace.  In most of the rest of the country, the power of pipeline companies to impact gas prices is limited in various ways, including prohibiting them from owning the gas that moves through their lines.  Prices are typically capped, published and readily available to buyers and sellers.  Texas has no such rules.  Instead, we give pipeline companies power that borders on monopolistic, allowing them to own the gas they transport and to hide their pricing and capacity until days after gas is sold, leaving buyers and sellers in the dark during negotiations.  This came home to roost last February when Winter Storm Uri shut down much of the state’s electric grid, leaving “natural” gas in short supply and great demand.  Within days, companies like Energy Transfer and Kinder Morgan – two of our 'Terrible 12' fossil fuel exporters – raised gas prices astronomically (in at least one case, from $3 per million British thermal units to $500 per mmbtu), quickly earning the two companies combined profits of $3.4 billion and leaving Texans to pay the tab for the next decade or longer.  Think state leaders might do something about it?  Think again.  Pipeline companies are regulated by the three elected Railroad Commissioners.  Between 2015 and 2020, companies with permit applications before the commission donated over $2.6 million to their campaigns.  In the immortal words of Jerry Reed, they get the goldmine and we get the shaft…\\nhttps://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Texas-gas-market-pipeline-companies-17145574.php\"],\n",
