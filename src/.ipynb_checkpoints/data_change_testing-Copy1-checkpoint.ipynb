In most of the rest of the country, the power of pipeline companies to impact gas prices is limited in various ways, including prohibiting them from owning the gas that moves through their lines.

Within days, companies like Energy Transfer and Kinder Morgan – two of our 'Terrible 12' fossil fuel exporters – raised gas prices astronomically (in at least one case, from $3 per million British thermal units to $500 per mmbtu), quickly earning the two companies combined profits of $3.4 billion and leaving Texans to pay the tab for the next decade or longer.
